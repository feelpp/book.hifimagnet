[[introduction]]
== Introduction

High Field Magnets modeling relies on a coupled nonlinear multiphysic model that involves:

* electromagnetism,
* thermics,
* mechanics
* and thermohydraulics for the cooling.

The nonlinearity arise from the dependencies of the physical properties of the copper alloy materials
that compose the insert (ie. the so-called helices). Indeed the electrical and thermal conductivity
depends on the temperature field following the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiedemann%E2%80%93Franz_law[Wiedemann-Frantz law]:
stem:[\frac{k(T)}{\sigma(T)\,T} = L], where stem:[L] is a material dependent constant.

The coupling of each physics is sketched in the chart bellow.
Details on each physics will be given in the following sections.
Finally, a specific section will be devoted to a simpler axisymetrical model
used mostly for quick calculations and optimzation.

== Coupled Model

[[magneto]]
=== Electromagnetic

The starting point of the electromagnetic model is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations[Maxwell equations].
Using a classical approach we rewritte the equations by introducing the gauged magnetic and electric potentials, namely stem:[\mathbf{A}] and stem:[V].
This leads to the following equation:

[stem]
++++
\epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} + \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} - \sigma \mathbf{u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) + \nabla \times (\frac{1}{\mu} \nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = -\sigma \nabla V - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\epsilon \nabla V\right) \qquad \text{in} \,  \mathbf{R}^3
++++

We add the conservation of current:

[stem]
++++
\nabla \cdot \left( \sigma ( -\nabla V - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}  + \mathbf{u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A})\right) = 0 \qquad \text{in} \,  \Omega.
++++

[NOTE]
====
We use the classical Coulomb gauge to properly define the magnetic potential (ie stem:[\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}=0]).
Moreover we have assume that no material exhibits an aimantation nor a polarization. 
====

====  QuasiStatic Maxwell (QMS)

In our case, we will neglect the second order time derivative.
The final system of EDP to be solved is:

[stem]
++++
\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} - \sigma \mathbf{u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) + \nabla \times (\frac{1}{\mu} \nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = -\sigma \nabla V \qquad \text{in} \,  \mathbf{R}^3
++++

[stem]
++++
\nabla \cdot \left( \sigma ( -\nabla V + \mathbf{u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} \right) = 0 \qquad \text{in} \,  \Omega.
++++

==== Magnetostatic

The steady state regime will be given by:

[stem]
++++
\nabla \times (\frac{1}{\mu} \nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = -\sigma \nabla V \qquad \text{in} \,  \mathbf{R}^3
++++

[stem]
++++
\nabla \cdot \left( \sigma ( -\nabla V + \mathbf{u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) \right) = 0 \qquad \text{in} \, \Omega.
++++

The boundary conditions are of 2 types:

* stem:[\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{0]], Homogeneous Dirichlet for mimicking condition at infinity,
* stem:[\mathbf{A} \cross \mathbf{n} = 0] on symetry plane and on boundaries of input/output current leads. 

==== Biot-Savart law

In the case of non magnetic materials (ie stem:[\mu=\mu_0]), we can easily derive a solution using
the Biot Savart law for the steady state regime:

[stem]
++++
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{X}) = \mu_0 \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{j} \, G(\mathbf{X},Y) \,d\Omega_\mathbf{X} \qquad \forall \mathbf{X} \in  \, \mathbf{R^3} 
++++

where stem:[G(\mathbf{X},Y)] stands for the Green function and stem:[\mathbf{j} = - \sigma \nabla V].

[NOTE]
====
From a mathematical point of view we can refer to this solution as the fundamental solution for the laplace equation: stem:[- \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = \mu_0 \mathbf{j}].
====

[[thermoelec]]
=== ThermoElectric

The temperature field stem:[T] is given by the classical heat equation with the Joule losses as the source term withing stem:[\Omega]:

[stem]
++++
\rho C_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla T - \nabla ( k \nabla T) = \mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{e} \qquad \text{in} \,  \Omega.
++++

The boundary conditions associated are mainly of 3 types:

* Robin for cooled surfaces: stem:[-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \mathbf{n}} = h (T-T_w)],
* Radiation conditons: stem:[-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \mathbf{n}} = \epsilon_T T^4],
* Homogeneous Neumann for other boundaries: stem:[-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \mathbf{n}} = 0].

In the current version radiation conditions are not implemented.


[[meca]]
=== Elasticity

To model the mechanical behaviour of our magnets submitted to the action of Lorentz forces stem:[\mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{b}],
thermal expansion and to the pressure of the water flow used for the cooling, we use the classical formulation: 

[stem]
++++
\nabla \cdot {\bar{\bar{\sigma}}} + \mathbf{j} \times \mathbf{b} = \rho \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial t^2} - \rho \nabla P,
++++

[stem]
++++
{\bar{\bar{\epsilon}}} = \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \mathbf{u} + \nabla \mathbf{u}^T ),
++++

[stem]
++++
{\bar{\bar{\sigma}}} = C : {\bar{\bar{\sigma}}}. 
++++

In testbooks the latest equation is referred as the Hooke law which represents the constitutive equation for linear material.
This equation may be also expressed by: 
[stem]
++++
{\bar{\bar{\sigma}}} = \frac{Y}{1+\nu}\left( {\bar{\bar{\epsilon}}} + \frac{\nu}{1+2\nu} {\bar{\bar{\epsilon}}}^T \right)
++++

To account for the thermal expansion of the material we add to the stress tensor stem:[{\bar{\bar{\sigma}}}]:

[stem]
++++
{\bar{\bar{\sigma}}}^T = - \frac{Y}{1+\nu} \,\alpha_T \, (T-T_0)\, {\bar{\bar{I}}}
++++
with stem:[{\bar{\bar{I}}}] the identity tensor, and stem:[T_0] is a reference temperature.

[[cooling]]
=== ThermoHydraulics

Cooling the magnet is mandatory to evacuate Joules losses and to keep magnet temperature bellow some
heuristic limit as some copper alloys can have poor mechanical behavior at high temperature. The cooling
is ensured by a forced water flow with a volumic flow rate stem:[Q] up to 150 l/s.

The total heat elevation in the water stem:[\Delta T_w] may be easily estimated from the electrical power stem:[P_e] dissipated
by the magnet using :

[stem]
++++
\Delta T_w = \frac{P_e}{\rho_w C_p Q}
++++

To model the heat exchange coefficient stem:[h] we use standard thermohydraulic correlation:

[stem]
++++
h = \frac{\alpha R_e^n P_r^m}{D_h},
++++

with stem:[Re] the Reynolds number, stem:[Pr] the Prandlt number and stem:[D_h] the hydraulic diameter.
These quantities are defined by cooling channels:
[stem]
++++
R_e = \frac{\rho u}{\mu},
++++

[stem]
++++
P_r = \frac{\mu C_p}{k},
++++

[stem]
++++
D_h = 2 (r^{(n+1)}_1 - r^{(n)}_2).
++++

Note that stem:[\mu] stands here for the viscosity of water.

The flow velocity stem:[u] per cooling channel is defined by:

[stem]
++++
u = \sqrt{\displaystyle \frac{2 \Delta P}{\rho \left[P_{in}+P_{out} + c \frac{L}{D_h}\right]}}
++++

where stem:[\Delta P] is the pressure drop applied to force the flow (typically 25 bar),
stem:[P_{in}] and stem:[P_{out}] are additionnal hydraulic pressure drop at the input and output of the magnet.

In practice, an alternative correlation named after B. Montgomery,
who has been a pionnering engineer in the field of Magnet design, is commonly used:

[stem]
++++
h = 1426*(1+1.5e-2 T_w) u^{0.8} / D_h^{0.2}.
++++
