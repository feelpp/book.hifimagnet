Welcome to {hifimagnet} processing documentation!

== Directory structure

The simulations results are stored in the directory defined by
the `directory` key in the cfg file. This path is relative to
the directory `feel` defined in your environment or by default.


[NOTE]
====
The `FEELPP_REPOSITORY` environment variable define
the default value for `feel` directory.

When running {hifimagnet} or {feelpp} apps on premise,
 `FEELPP_REPOSITORY` points to `$HOME/feel` if not explicitly specified.

When using container, `FEELPP_REPOSITORY` is set to `/feel` in
the container. When running the container, you actually mount
a user defined directory as the `/feel` directory in the container
using for instance `-B $PWD:/feel` in {singularity}.
====

.Structure of `feel` directory
[source,sh]
----
include::{examplesdir}/feel-dir-struc.txt[]
----

The results, per se, are stored in the `np_32` directory.
The name changes according to the number of cores you have used for running your simulations.
The content of this directory depends on the xref:user:index.adoc#PostProcessJson[`PostProcess` section] in the json model file.
Generally this directory will hold:

* some `csv` files,
* some `physic.save` directories that contain solution for `physic` in hdf5 format,
* some `physic.exports` directories that contain files for visualization for each `physic`

In addition you can find files for logging what has been done during the simulation
and some journal files to access some statistics about your simulation.


[[csv]]
== Viewing `csv` files

`csv` files contains the data corresponding to `Measures` data.
These files may be read using any csv apps.

[NOTE]
====
using matplotlib and pandas
====

[[ensight]]
== Using {ensight}

`physic.export` directory contain files for visualization. The native format for this file is `Ensight  Gold`.


[[ensight_on_premise]]
=== On Premise

* type `ensight202`

[[ensight_remote]]
=== Remote rendering

For large simulation, we advise you to use ensight remote rendering mode,
even if you can connect via `ssh -Y` to the server where the results are stored.
Of course, this requires that {ensight} is installed on you machine and on the server.

[NOTE]
====
{ensight} is not installed on Gricad machine. You need to download your results data
for visualization.
====

To start remote rendering, on Linux just type:

[source,sh]
----
[~trophime/Ansys_exec/ansys_inc/v202/CEI/bin/]ceistart202
----

on windows:

[source,bat]
----
["C:\Program Files\Ansys Inc\v202\CEI\bin"\]ceistart202
----

* Check the `Remote Server` menu,
* Enter the name of `Remote computer` to be used
* Uncheck the `ssh Tunnel` options
* Click on `Launch`

After some seconds (or minutes) depending on your connection, you will get the main {ensight} window.

image:Ensight-main.png[Ensight main window]

Finaly, click on `Cancel` and proceed to load your data.
From the top menu `File`:

* click on `Open`
* navigate to your data `Export` directory
* Select the `case` file

In the left part of {ensight} windows, you shall see the details of the loaded parts for your `case`

image:Ensight-loaddata.png[Loading a thermoelectric simulation]

Now you can select your `case` in the part view and move you data in the main visualization frame with mouse buttons.

image:Ensight-loaddata1.png[Loading a thermoelectric simulation]

[NOTE]
====
By default, the geometry will be displayed as wireframes.
To change this default, once you have slected your parts you have to switch to `3D full model`.
This may be done by clicking on the "cube" icon.

==== Viewing a field

To view the temperature field in the magnet:

* right click on the selected part
* 

image:Ensight-displaydata.png[Display temperature field]


Now we will remove 1/4th of the insert to have a better view of the temperature distribution.
To do so:

* select all the parts,
* click on the scissors icon

This will bring up a new window:

image:Ensight-removebox.png[Remove part of the insert]

* check box and outside from the slidding menus
* check `advanced`
* define the geometry of the box
* finaly click on `create with selected part` at the button of newly create windows

image:Ensight-displaydata-detail.png[Define box geometry]

You shall see something like that:

image:Ensight-displaydata-detailres.png[Display detailed temperature distribution]


==== Plotting field profiles

To view the temperature field distribution along a line, proceed as follows:

* click on "Query" icon image:Ensight_plotbutton.png[]

* select type of query and a field to plot:

image:Ensight_queryplot.png[Query tools]

* click on Tool location to secify the position of the lines

image:Ensight_linetool.png[Plot over line tool]

Finaly you shall get a plot that will be displayed in the main windows.

image:Ensight_T_profile.png[View Temperature profile on Ox axis]


==== Exporting query data

To export query data for use in an external software:

* Select the `Plot/Queries` tab in the bottom left part of ensight window,
* Select the query you want to export
* Right click on the selected query to show an optional menu
* Select `Data`
* Select the format for the export

image:Ensight_exportdata.png[Export query data]

==== Save image

To save ensight window in an image, just use:

* From the main menu: `File/export/image`

A window will pop up. Fill the empty field to actually save the image.

image:Ensight_saveimage.png[Export an image]

==== Using Ensight {hifimagnet} toolbox

For sake of use, a number of extensions has been developped to perform
more easily certain operations while processing {hifimagnet} simulations
results. These tools are group in a toolbox.

To access the toolbox, click on the toolbox icon image:Ensight-toolboxicon.png[] :

* click on the + button in front of HiFiMagnet to have the list of existing extension,
* click on the extension you would like to run

A window will pop up for most of the extensions.

image:Ensight_toolbox.png[Ensight toolbox]

Fill the parameters requested, then click on `OK`.

image:Ensight_toolbox_ox.png[{hifimagnet} Plot over X dialog menu]

Detailled list of extensions:

* plots extensions:
** `Over Ox`: profile of a field along an line on Ox axis,
** `Over Oy`: profile of a field along an line on Oy axis,
** `Over Oz`: profile of a field along an line on Oz axis,
** `Over Theta`: profile of a field along a circle at a given `z` altitude.

* statistics extensions:
** `pdf graph`: display an histogramme of the fraction of volume per iso-value of a field,
** `statistics`: display statistic by domains (aka markers)

TODO

* `One Case`:
* `Compare two cases`:

* `Define Units`:

==== Using Ensight python interface

It is also very convenient in Ensight to run some python script in background to extract/generate some data
for a given case without having to really "open" Ensight. To do so, you can use something like that:

[source,sh]
----
ensight102 [-batch] -p my_script.py -pyargv my_script_arguments -endpyargv -batch`
----

The `-batch` option force ensight to work in batch mode (ie. without any user intervention and without the need to open ensgiht).

As an example:

[source,sh]
----
ensight102 -X [-batch] -p probe_voltage.py -pyargv -i test/hdg-ibc/HL-31/P1/np_32/hdg.poisson.electro.exports/Export.case -o I25kA_dittus_perH.dat -endpyargv
----

This will extract computed voltage at given points from `Export.case`.
