In this test case, we consider a polyhelix magnet consisting of 2 helices operated at a low current.
The simulations are compared with experimental results, more precisely with magnetic field measurements
with a 3D hall probe in the zone of interest for researchers.

The magnetic field produced  will be computed on a zone of interest namely a cylinder along the helicesZ-Axis.


== Running the case

As the CAD generation is time consuming, the mesh is provided but will eventually need to be partitionned.
However if you ever want to rebuild the CAD and Mesh you will find detailled instructions bellow.

To run this example on MSO4SC portal see this section.

=== Creating the geometry

[source,sh]
----
salome -t $HIFIMAGNET_SALOME_DIR/HIFIMAGNET_Cmd.py args:--cfg=BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes.yaml,--hideIsolant
----

=== Creating the mesh

[source,sh]
----
salome -t $HIFIMAGNET_SALOME_DIR/HIFIMAGNET_Cmd.py args:--insert=BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes.yaml,--hideIsolant,--mesh
----

=== Create the zone of interest for the magnetic field calculation and generate corresponding mesh:

[source,sh]
----
gmsh -3 -bin BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes-biotsavart_z_wo_glue.geo -o BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes_wo_isolant.msh
----

The dimensions of the box may be changed in the geo:

[source,geo]
----
Merge "BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes.med";

hs=5;
rbox = 10;
zbox0 = -45;
zbox1 = 185;
Include "createbox.geo";
----


=== Partitionning the mesh:

[source,sh]
----
feelpp_mesh_partitioner --ifile BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes_wo_isolant.msh  --part 32  --nochdir
----

=== Running the model with couplecartmodel app:

[source,sh]
----
mpirun -np 32 feelpp_hfm_coupledcartmodel_3DP1N1 --config-file H3H4.cfg
----

== Data files

=== Geometry files

* BancMesure_H3H4_with_shapes.yaml
* HL27-H3_with_shapes.yaml
* HL27-H4_with_shapes.yaml
* Ring-H3H4.yaml

with data for defining the helical cut:

* HL27-H3_with_shapes_cut_salome.dat
* HL27-H4_with_shapes_cut_salome.dat

=== Mesh files

* BancMesure_H3H4_meshdata.yaml


=== Model files

* H3H4_thermoelec.json
* H3H4_magcart.json

=== Model files

* H3H4.cfg

=== Measurements data


== Outputs


== Notes

the executables must be in the path or should be prefixed with appropriate directories.

For instance on Lncmi server:
```
FEELPP_MESH_APPS_DIR=$FEELPP_BUILD_DIR/applications/mesh/
HIFIMAGNET_APPS_DIR=~/feelpp_build/new_Json/research/hifimagnet/applications
HIFIMAGNET_SALOME_DIR=~/SALOME-8.3.0-DB9.5/INSTALL/HIFIMAGNET/bin/salome
```

The coupledcart model is in ```$HIFIMAGNET_APPS_DIR/CoupledCartModel/```
