= QuarterTurn

In this example, we will estimate the rise in temperature due to Joules losses in a stranded conductor. An electrical potential stem:[V_0] is applied to the entry/exit of the conductor which is also cooled by a force flow. +
The geometry of the conductor is choosen as to have an analytical expression for the temperature.

== Geometry

The conductor consists in a rectangular cross section torus which is somehow "cut" to allow for applying electrical potential. The conductor is cooled with a force flow along its cylindrical faces.+
In 2D, the geometry is as follow:

In 3D, this is the same geometry, but extruded along the z axis.

As the mesh is, by default in *mm*, we use specific units for this tests.

=== Model & Toolbox

- This problem is fully described by a Thermo-Electric model, namely a poisson equation for the electrical potential stem:[V] and a standard heat equation for the temperature field stem:[T] with Joules losses as a source term.

=== Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions for the electrical probleme are introduced as simple Dirichlet boundary conditions for the electric potential on the entry/exit of the conductor. For the remaining faces, as no current is flowing througth these faces, we add Homogeneous Neumann conditions.

As for the heat equation, the forced water cooling is modeled by robin boundary condition with stem:[Tw] the temperature of the coolant and stem:[h] an heat exchange coefficient.

To change the mesh size `hsize` just edit the cfg file and change the corresponding line:

[source,cfg]
----
dim=3
units=mm
geofile=quarter-turn3D.geo
geofile-path=$cfgdir
...

[gmsh]
filename=$cfgdir/quarter-turn3D.geo
hsize=1
