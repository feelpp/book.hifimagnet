= Building from scratch

* First create a directory to hold salome tarball release:

[source,sh]
----
mkdir -p $HOME/Salome_Packages
----

* Prepare the archives directory in `SALOME-${VERSION}/ARCHIVES`
that contains the sources tarballs of the pre-requisites

* Check or create a new application in `PROJECT/applications`,
see for instance link:https://github.com/feelpp/hifimagnet/blob/Salome_8.3.0/docker/salome/PROJECT/applications/SALOME-8.3.0-native.pyconf[SALOME-8.3.0.pyconf]

* Launch the building of salome

[source,sh]
----
./build_salome_new.sh -v $VERSION -p \$DIST -m [-d]
----

where `-m` enable MPI support and -d is used for debugging purposes.

The actual build process involves:

* the creation of a temporary docker image to hold
the salomeTools suite that perform the installation.
The prerequisites are:

** pyconf file describing the requested configuration
** directory SALOME_$VERSION: holding the archive tarball of the dependencies,

* The Salome tarball is written into $HOME/Salome_Packages directory
* the creation of a docker image holding VERSION of Salome plus a graphic driver.

[NOTE]
====
Only drive for nvidia is installed
====

The image can be pushed to link:https://hub.docker.com/r/feelpp/salome/[feelpp/salome dockerhub].
[source,sh]
----
docker login
docker tag ...
docker push
----


[TIP]
====
On Windows 10 Pro you have to:

* install MobaXterm to get a X11 server,
* install WSL,
* install Debian/Stretch from Windows Store,

To install {salome} in WSL Debian/Stretch:

* start Debian
* setup lncmi debian repository
* install {salome} binary for Debian/Stretch in Debian WSL.

Then to run {salome}:

* start MobaXterm to get X11 up and running
* launch Debian from menu or by typing debian.exe in a powershell
* from the "debian" terminal, run {salome}

Note that you may have to add some missing packages to get salome
working.
