include::{partialsdir}/mso4sc-uri.adoc[]


This document will provide basic informations for *EndUsers* :

* to connect to the {uri-msoportal-www}[Portal],
* to purchase an {hifimagnet} application,
* to run an {hifimagnet} application.

An overview of the main portal functionalities is given in this <<overview,section>>.
This is followed by a brief description of the {hifimagnet} apps available and on the over-whole workflow
of actually running apps within the portal.

The user that have already an account on the {uri-msoportal-www}[Portal] may skip the next section
and go directly to the section related to his/her role:

* xref::dev.adoc#devuser[*DevUser*]
* xref::user.adoc#enduser[*EndUser*]

NOTE: The main difference between *EndUser* and *DevUser* is that the latter can register an {hifimagnet} application.

[[connect]]
== Get an account on *MSO4SC Portal*

Connect to {uri-msoportal-www}[MSOPortal]

image::PortalMSO4SC.png[login page MSOPortal]

* Click on *login*

You will be forwarded to IDM component of the portal.

image::PortalMSO4SC_idm.png[IDM component of MSOPortal]

* *Sign up* to get an account

image::PortalMSO4SC_signup.png[IDM component of MSOPortal]

TIP: Do not check *gravatar* for your avatar as it is buggy right now.

* Create an account there providing a valid email and a password.

Then you have to validate your account by following the instructions send
by the portal to your email address.

// NOTE: Right now the portal *is not* using https protocol. As a consequence, the credentials `user/password` are
// sent in clear. So be careful.

[NOTE]
====
In the sequel, each time you start a new service that relies on the IDM component responsible for the authentification
you will be notify by the system and will have to *authorize* this service like in the image below:

[[overview]]
== Overview of the Portal

image::PortalMSO4SC_login.png[Main page for MSOPortal]

the portal is split into several services:

* *Marketplace*, where you can add and/or purchase applications
* *Data Catalogue*, where you can add and/or retrieve data
* *Experiments*, where the app is setup and the simulation is launched
* *Visualization*, to access a Remote desktop to pre and/or post-processes your simulations
* *Data*, to access the data transfert tools (aka globus)
* *Source*, to access to {uri-gitlab-cesga}[cesga gitlab]
* *Containers*, to access to the {uri-sregistry-cesga}[cesga sregistry]
* *Q & A*, to access the Community tools for asking/answering specific questions
* *Docs*, to access the general documentation for MSO4SC project
* *Feedback*, to answer the questionnaire for MSO4SC project

more details on:

* https://github.com/MSO4SC/MSOPortal/blob/master/portal/README.adoc[MSO4SC Front-end & Experiments Tool]
* https://business-api-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/v5.4.1/user-programmer-guide.html[*Marketplace* User manual]
* https://ckan.org/documentation-and-api/[*Data Catalogue* docs]

[NOTE]
====
For smooth operations of {uri-msoportal-www}[portal], the following ports have to be *open*:

* `3000`: *IDM*, the service responsible for authentification 
* `5000`: *MarketPlace*
* `8000`: *Data Catalogue*

To check, you can use `nmap -p <port> portal.mso4sc.eu`.

You may need to contact your system admin to check and eventually open these ports.

[[mso_setup]]
=== Setup your account

You need to proceed to the following steps to setup your account properly.
The configuration for {sregistry} and the uploading of licenses key is optional
for most user except for the {hifimagnet} ones.

[[hpc_setting]]
==== Setting up an HPC resource in *Experiments*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *User Infrastructure*
* From the sliding menu, select a predefined  HPC resource
* Enter a *Name*
* Enter your credentials

**Add an image here**

// [source,txt]
// ----
// include::{examplesdir}/hpc.txt[]
// ----

To enter a new HPC resource

* Select *User Infrastructure*


[[setup_post]]
==== Setting up an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-visu-www}[*Visualization*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a Remote Desktop resource

[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/remotedesktop.txt[]
----

[[setup_api_key]]
==== Setting up *Data Catalogue key*

* Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
** Click on *View Profile*

image::ckan_view_profile.png[*Data Catalogue* user profile]

** Scroll dow to view you *Data Catalogue key* on left side

image::ckan_apikey.png[Getting *Data Catalogue key*]

* Copy the key
* Connect to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
** Select "Data repositories"
** Paste or Enter your *Data Catalogue key*

image::setting_ckanapikey.png[Adding *Data Catalogue key* in *Settings*]

[[using_sregistry]]
==== Setting up {sregistry} service

Before proceeding to the setup of the app, you need to make sure, at least for {hifimagnet}
 app (or more generally for apps requiring access to a private singularity image) that you have
 been granted the proper right on {hifimagnet} {sregistry} team. You shall have received an email
 with a link to join {hifimaget} {sregistry} team.  Remember to first log in {cesga} {sregistry} before joining the team. 

One more step consists in retrieving the *TOKEN* and storing it into your home directory on the HPC resource.
 This *TOKEN* is needed to download programmatically the {singularity} image :

* click on *Container* main menu to connect to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{cesga} {sregistry}]
* click on *Sign In with FiWare* to enter the service
* go to your account (top right button)
* select *Token*

// * connect to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}] using {fiware} authentification

image::sregistry_token.png[ex: {Get {sregistry} token]
image::sregistry_apitoken.png[ex: {Display {sregistry} token]

* copy the token into a file `.sregistry`
* copy `.sregistry` on the HPC resource, see <<hpc_setting, previously defined>>, into your home directory

[[note_sregistry_secret]]
[NOTE]
====
To copy the file to the HPC resource you can use `scp .sregistry username@hpc_host:.`
or whatever method you prefer. `username` and `hpc_host` are key defined in the <<hpc_setting,HPC resource setting>>.

You may connect to your account on HPC resource
```
ssh -Y username@hpc_host
```

If you cannot connect directly to the HPC resource, you may have to use alternative.
On cesga, you can either:

* connect to https://portalusuarios.cesga.es/auth[cesga user portal] with your credentials,
* click on *Create a new Desktop* to get a remote desktop
* in a *terminal* try to `scp user@yourmachine/.sregistry  $HOME`

an alternative consists in:

* a *VPN* solution: use cesga *fortisvpn client*

```
/opt/forticlient-sslvpn/64bit/forticlientsslvpn_cli --server gateway.cesga.es:443 --vpnuser user_email
```
====

[[using_licenses]]
=== Uploading license keys

If you wish to perform pre and processing, you may need to upload license keys on the hpc ressource
you plan to use.

To do so you may proceed for each license key as in the <<note_sregistry_secret, note>> above for {sregistry} secret.

For new user we recommend to read this guide. The impatient may go directly to the xref::user.adoc#enduser[*EndUser*]
 and try to run the basic demonstrator.

== Synopsis of the {hifimagnet} Offering

The {hifimagnet} offering is created by *DevUser* as described in this xref::dev.adoc#registerapp[section].
