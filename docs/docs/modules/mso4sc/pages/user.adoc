TIP: When running into some strange portal behavior, first try to `logout/login` from the portal
before reporting an issue.

An *EndUser* can:

* <<purchase, purchase>> an application from the *MarketPlace*,
* <<data, manage>> datasets and Organizations in the *Data Catalogue*,
* <<running, run>> application in *Experiments*

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some apps are freely available for all portal users.
To use these apps, you can skip the purchase step.
Right now all {hifimagnet} apps are freely available.

Before going to the {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
it is mandatory to connect at least to {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*] 
and to the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*].

To use and create private datasets for storing inputs data and results,
you have to upload your *Data Catalogue key* into the Experiments *settings*
as described <<api_key, here>>.
====

[[purchase]]
=== Purchase an application

To purchase an application from the *Marketplace* you can either be *DevUser*
or a simple *EndUser*. The process is the following:

* connect to the {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*], in *Home* (top left Marketplace page) you will find all available apps (*All categories*).
* click on *Add to Cart* to purchase the app you want.
* click on *Shopping Cart* and *Checkout* to go on
** fill the required forms for *shipping address*
** provide a *shipping address* if not already defined
** provide a *billing address* if not already defined
** finalize your order by clicking on *Checkout*

To use the app, you will have to wait that the owner/seller of the app validate
you order. To check the status of your order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *Product Orders*

You shall see your products and their status in each product form.

To finalize your purchase *DO NOT FORGET* to connect to :

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]

Then notify the owner/seller that you request to be part of {hifimagnet} user group.
This will allow you to access {hifimagnet} singularity images and datasets.

[NOTE]
====
To access http://docs.cemosis.fr/hifimagnet/stable/[{hifimagnet} docs] you also need to have a user/password.
====

// NOTE: The use of {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder} is optional.

[[data]]
= Data Catalogue

Any user of the platform can create and manage *Organization* in the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
to deal with private datasets.

== Create and Manage *Organization*

* connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* click on *Organizations*
* click on *Add Organization*

You, then, need to fill the form and finalize the creation by clicking on the *create organization* button.

You have then to manage user that are allowed to be part of your organization.
They may have the following roles:

* *Admin* : can view/add dataset, add user and manage role
* *Editor* : can add dataset
* *Member* : can view dataset


See the video bellow for a demo.

video::Wq713I6HM2I[youtube]

NOTE: Users have to connect at least once to *Data Catalogue* before you can grant them a role in your organization.

[[api_key]]
== Upload Data

To use private Organization and/or Dataset you would need to enter
*Data Catalogue key* in the *Settings* menu. For instructions see xref::index.adoc#setup_api_key[here].

NOTE: To add a dataset to an existing organization, you may need to ask the *Admin* of the organization to be granted the role of *Editor* to do so. In our case it is the owner/seller of {hifimagnet} app.
to set <hpc_feelpp> to a specific directory for each instance.
// [[using_girder]]
// === Upload Data to {girder} service



[[running]]
= Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments*

image::PortalMSO4SC_Exp_User.png[*Experiments* *Instances* main menu for *EndUSer*]

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *Add a new instance*
** define an ID
** select a registered app in the sliding menu

At this point you should have a page with all the options that need to be filled.

image::portal_magtherm_inputs.png[ex: {hifimagnet} app `MagTherm`]

The fields to fill may be grouped into categories:

* specs for running simulations
* HPC settings
* specs retrieving singularity images
* specs for singularity image

The *EndUser* shall only need to fill the fields related to the 1st and 2nd category.
The fields that are to be filled by *EndUser* are marked in *bold*.

The others fields are designed for more advanced users.

Once filled, click on *Create New Instance*.

TIP: While creating a new app instance, any error will result in a pop-up message.

image::portal_magtherm_running.png[ex: Running {hifimagnet} `MagTherm`]

The next step is to launch the app:

* select the instance *ID*, you defined in the previous step,
* click on *Run*, wait until the button in blue turns green.

Then you have access to:

* the *execution logs*: monitor the workflow (deploying the instance, running the boostrap/revert script and executing the tasks), 
* the *applications logs*: monitor specific logs for the instance ran.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The result are stored in `<hpc_feelpp>`. Make sure that `<hpc_volumes>` bindmount list option contains this field: eg `<hpc_feelpp>:/feel` on cesga where `<hpc_feelpp>=$LUSTRE/feel`.

As a best practice, we **highly recommend** the user to set `<hpc_feelpp>` to a specific directory for each instance.

It means that the actual simulation results are stored in:

* `<hpc_feelpp>/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/<geofile>/thermoelectric-linear_V1T1_N1/np_<parallel_tasks>` for MagThel app.

`<geofile>` correspond to the input with the same name in the <cfgfile>.

When running the instance *ID*:

* a directory `<hpc_basedir>/<workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>` will be created (`<id> is a random number);
* the dataset will eventually be downloaded and extracted into this directory;
* the script `<job_prefix><sid>.script` will be created and submitted to the queueing system of the HPC ressource.

Upon completion two files will be created in the directory:

* `<job_prefix><sid>.out`: contains the output of the script,
* `<job_prefix><sid>.err`: contains some log and errors if any.

A red button will indicates an error.
In this event, check the output of the script (aka `slurm-<id>.out`, the `.err` and `.out` files).
To do so you need to have `<workdir_keep>` set to `true`.
====

Finaly to destroy your instance *ID* , just click on:

* *Destroy Instance!*
* or *Force Destroy*

This will remove your instance *ID* from the instance list.

[[running_dataset]]
= Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments* using datasets from *DataCatalogue*

Basically the procedure is the same as <<running, above>>. The only difference here is that you need:

* to select a dataset in the *DataSet* sliding menu
* to select a ressource within the *DataSet* 
* to enter the name of the `<cfgfile>` you will use

You should at the end have something like in the following image.

image::portal_running_dataset.png[Selecting a dataset]


[NOTE]
====
The dataset, at least those from {hifimagnet} organization in the *Data Catalogue* are
gzipped archive that holds all the files needed to run:

* a mesh or cad file
* a `<cfgfile>`
* a list of `json` files for physical properties and/or boundary conditions
* eventually some more files when using some {magnettools} features (eg ...)

The format of the files in a dataset are respectively described in:

* for {hifimagnet} simulation 
* for mesh and cad format
* for {magnettools}

====


[[RemoteDesktop]]
= Running an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to *Visualization*
* Click *Desktop Available*
** Select your *Infrastructure* in the sliding menu

NOTE: If no *Remote desktop* is defined, you will receive a warning message. Create a xref::index.adoc#post[*Setting*], then go back to this step.

** Click on *Create*
** Click either on *Desktop* or *View Only*

It should start a web page within your browser.
In this page you should be able to:

* start a 'terminal' and check the output of your simulation

The outputs of the job (ie `slurm` jobs) are stored in the `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`.
The actual results for the simulation would be stored in `<hpc_feelpp>` directory following {feelpp} usage.


* start a post-processing GUI:
** either by loading {uri-paraview-www}[{paraview}]
** or using singularity {uri-ensight-www}[{ensight}] image
* to quit just click on `Menu/logout` (top left)

For more details on using {paraview} or {ensight} please check this xref:post:index.adoc#post_manual[section].
See the video bellow for a live demo.
