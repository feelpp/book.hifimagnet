TIP: when running into some strange portal behavior, first try to `logout/login` from the portal
before reporting an issue.

An *EndUser* can:

* <<purchase, purchase>> an application from the *MarketPlace*,
* <<data, manage>> datasets and Organizations in the *Data Catalogue*,
* <<running, run>> application in *Experiments*

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some apps are freely available for all portal users.
To use these apps, you can skip the purchase step.
Right now all {hifimagnet} apps are freely available.

Before going to the {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
it is mandatory to connect at least to {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*] 
and to the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*].

To use and create private datasets for storing inputs data and results,
you have to upload your *Data Catalogue key* into the Experiments *settings*
as described <<api_key, here>>.
====

[[purchase]]
=== Purchase an application

To purchase an application from the *Marketplace* you can either be *DevUser*
or a simple *EndUser*. The process is the following:

* connect to the {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*], in *Home* (top left Marketplace page) you will find all available apps (*All categories*).
* Click on *Add to Cart* to purchase the app you want.
* Click on *Shopping Cart* and *Checkout* to go on
** fill the required forms for *shipping address*
** provide a *shipping address* if not already defined
** provide a *billing address* if not already defined
** Finalize your order by clicking on *Checkout*

To use the app, you will have to wait that the owner/seller of the app validate
you order. To check the status of your order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *Product Orders*

You shall see your products and their status in each product form.

To finalize your purchase *DO NOT FORGET* to connect to :

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]

Then notify the owner/seller that you request to be part of {hifimagnet} user group.
This will allow you to access {himagnet} singularity images and datasets.

[NOTE]
====
To access http://docs.cemosis.fr/hifimagnet/stable/[{hifimagnet} docs] you also need to have a user/password
====

// NOTE: The use of {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder} is optional.

[[data]]
=== Data Catalogue

Any user of the platform can create and manage *Organization* in the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
to deal with private datasets.

==== Create and Manage *Organization*

* Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* click on *Organizations*
* click on *Add Organization*

You, then, need to fill the form and finalize the creation by clicking on the *create organization* button.

You have then to manage user that are allowed to be part of your organization.
They may the following role:

* *Admin* : can view/add dataset, add user and manage role
* *Editor* : can add dataset
* *Member* : can view dataset

NOTE: User has to connect at least once to *Data Catalogue* before you can grant them a role in your organization.

[[api_key]]
==== Upload Data

To use private Organization and/or Dataset you would need to enter
*Data Catalogue key* in the *Settings* menu. For instructions see xref::index.adoc#setup_api_key[here]

NOTE: To add a dataset to an existing organization, you may need to ask the *Admin* of the organization to be granted the role of *Editor* to do so. In our case it is the owner/seller of {hifimagnet} app.

// [[using_girder]]
// === Upload Data to {girder} service



[[running]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments*

image::PortalMSO4SC_Exp_User.png[*Experiments* *Instances* main menu for *EndUSer*]

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *Instances*
** define an ID
** select a registered app in the sliding menu

At this point you should have a page with all the options that need to be filled.

image::portal_magtherm_inputs.png[ex: {hifimagnet} app `MagTherm`]

The fields to fill may be grouped into categories:

* specs for running simulations
* HPC settings
* specs retrieving singularity images
* specs for singularity image

The *EndUser* shall only need to fill the fields related to the 1st and 2nd category.
The fields that are to be filled by *EndUser* are marked in *bold*.

The others fields are designed for more advanced users.

HPC settings for local {lncmi} ressources are specificied xref::lncmi-hpc.adoc[here]

Once filled, click on *Create New Instance*.

TIP: While creating a new app instance, any error will result in a popup message.

image::portal_magtherm_running.png[ex: Running {hifimagnet} `MagTherm`]

The next step is to to launch the app:

* select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step,
* click on *Run*, wait until the button in blue turns green


[TIP]
====
A red button will indicates an error.
Check the message in the frame bellow the status button.
To have more details about the actual error is more tricky; we recommend to:

* make sure you have unchecked the cleanup option
* connect to the HPC resource using for instance the <<RemoteDesktop, *Remote Desktop*>>
* move to the selected `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_working_prefix>_<date>_<id>`
* check the logs

`<hpc_basedir>` is given as inputs of the experiment (see above). 
`<hpc_working_prefix>` is set by default by the app (eg: `hifimagnet` for `M̀agTherm` app).
The `<id>` is a random character generated when creating the instance.

The `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>` directory remains present
only if `<do_not_delete_workdir>` is set to `true`.

This directory holds:

* `*.script`
* `slurm-*.out`
* `mso*.err`
* `mso*.out`

and eventually the files coming from the dataset.
====

Finaly to destroy your instance, just click on:

* *Destroy Instance!*
* or *Force Destroy*

This will remove your *ID* from the instance list.


[[running_dataset]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments* using datasets from *DataCatalogue*

Basically the procedure is the same as <<running, above>>. The only difference here is that you need:

* to select a dataset in the *DataSet* sliding menu
* to select a ressource within the *DataSet* 
* to enter the name of the `<cfgfile> you will use

You should at the end have something like in the following image.

image::portal_running_dataset.png[Selecting a dataset]


[NOTE]
====
The dataset, at least those from {hifimagnet} organization in the *Data Catalogue* are
gzipped archive that holds all the files needed to run:

* a mesh or cad file
* a `<cfgfile>`
* a list of `json` files for physical properties and/or boundary conditions
* eventually some more files when using some {magnettools} features (eg ...)

The format of the files in a dataset are respectively described in:

* for {hifimagnet} simulation 
* for mesh and cad format
* for {magnettools}

====


[[RemoteDesktop]]
=== Running an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to *Visualization*
* Click *Desktop Available*
** Select your *Infrastructure* in the sliding menu

NOTE: if no *Remote desktop* is defined, you will receive a warning message. Create a <<post, *Setting*>>, then go back to this step.

** Click on *Create*
** Click either on *Desktop* or *View Only*

it should start a web page within your browser.
In this page you should be able to:

* start a 'terminal' and check the output of your simulation

The outputs of the job (ie `slurm` jobs) are stored in the `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`.
The actual results for the simulation would be stored in `<hpc_basedir>/feel` directory following {feelpp} usage.

[NOTE]
====
The result are stored in `${LUSTRE}/feel/...` if
you have chosen to use the `<hpc_volumes>` bindmount option: eg `${LUSTRE}/feel:/feel` on cesga.

Check the output of the script (aka `slurm-<id>.out`) in `<basedir>/<workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`
to see the exact name of this directory.

In `slurm-<id>.out` you should see lines like that at the beginning of the files:

[source,log]

* start a post-processing GUI:
** either by loading {uri-paraview-www}[{paraview}]
