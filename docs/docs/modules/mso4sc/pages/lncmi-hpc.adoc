= HPC setting for local {lcnmi} ressources

Local {lncmi} computationnal ressources have been configured to be used within **MSO4SC Portal**.
To use these ressources you need an account on {lncmi} SI.

Two ressources are available:

* stokes (147.183.80.28)
* euler (147.173.80.14)

[NOTE]
====

* for Meshing you may need to `/opt/DISTENE/DLim:/opt/DISTENE/DLim:ro` to get access to {meshgems} license key.
On {cesga} it depends where was stored your key (eg. `${HOME}/MeshGems::/opt/DISTENE/DLim:ro`). `:ro` is added to mount in read only mode. 

* Prerequisites for a ressource to be used in the portal is:
** a workload manager installed (`slurm` is the only supported),
** ressource accessible from internet with `ssh` either directly or throught a ssh-tunnel.
