You can use ether the linear or the nonlinear model for your calculation, but for our example, we use the linear model, so we select the `thermoelectric-linear` (respectively `thermoelectric-nonlinear`) model in the Json file (details in the <<code.json>>).

When all the files (detailed below) are created, you can run your calculation with this command :

----
mpirun -np "number_of_processor_you_have_chosen_in_the_partition"
feelpp_hfm_thermoelectric_model_3D_V1T1_N1 --config-file "name_of_your_file.cfg"

There is a dedicated section in the Json file, named `Materials`, to configure the magnet properties.
The structure of a json file is as follows (conditions are details in <<Condition>>) :

[[code.json]]
[source,json]
.Example . json
....
{
    "Name": "ThermoElectric",
    "ShortName":"TE",
    "Model":"thermoelectric-linear",
    "Materials":
    {
	   "Name_of_the_first_volume":
	    {
	     "name":"material_of_this_volume",
	      "alpha":"_",
	      "T0":"_",
	      "sigma0":"_",
	      "k0":"_",
	      "sigma":"sigma0/(1+alpha*(T-T0)):sigma0:alpha:T:T0",
	      "k":"k0*T/((1+alpha*(T-T0))*T0):k0:T:alpha:T0"
	    },
	  "other_volume":
	   {
	    ...
	   }
  },
    "BoundaryConditions":
    {
	   "first_condition(like potential or temperature)":
	    {
	     "type_of_condition":
	      {
		      "Surface_concerned_by_the_condition":
		        {
		          "expr1":"_",
		          "expr2":"_"
		        },
		      "Surface_concerned_by_the_condition":
		        {
		          "expr1":"_",
		          "expr2":"_"
		        }
	      }
	   },
	    "other_condition":
	     {
	      ...
	     }
    },
    "PostProcess":
      {
	     "Fields":["temperature","potential","current"]
      }
}
....
WARNING: The name of the volumes and surfaces must be the same as defined in `Salome`.
Be careful to the units of the material properties. They need to be consistent with the length unit used for the rest.
For instance the length unit is in *mm* in <<test.json>>.

It is also necessary to create a file to configure the calculation, call `.cfg` file (example <<example_file.cfg>>).
It will configure which file you will use in your calculations and which type of solver you use (here we use the Krylov method to solve both `electro` and `thermal` problem).

[source,cfg]
.Example_linear.cfg
....
dim=3
geofile="name_of_the_file_created_by_the_partition.json" (or .msh)
geofile-path=$cfgdir


conductor_volume="name_of_your_volume"

[thermoelectric]
model_json=$cfgdir/"name_of_your_file.json"
weakdir=false

[electro]
pc-type=gamg
#ksp-monitor=true
ksp-rtol="relative_convergence_tolerance"
ksp-atol="absolute_convergence_tolerance"
ksp-maxit="maximum_number_of_iterations"
ksp-use-initial-guess-nonzero=1

[thermal]
pc-type=gamg
#ksp-monitor=true
ksp-rtol="relative_convergence_tolerance"
ksp-atol="absolute_convergence_tolerance"
ksp-use-initial-guess-nonzero=1
....

There are few differences between the linear and the nonlinear calculation.
For the nonlinear model, just add this lines in the section `thermoelectric` :

.nonlinear
....
eps_potential=1.e-4
eps_temperature=1.e-4
resolution=picard
itmax_picard=10
update_intensity=true
marker_intensity="the_surface"
target_intensity="the_intensity" (be careful of the sign)
eps_intensity=1.e-2
verbosity=2
....

We can define the current I using the Ohm's law, defining the voltage ine the `json` file.

== Condition

There are three type of conditions :

1 *Dirichlet*

The values of the solution is known at the limits of the domain.

[source,json]
.Dirichlet Condition
....
"Dirichlet":
  {
    "Surface":
      {
        "expr1":"Value_of_the_solution",
        "expr2":"Volume_concerned"
      },
    "other_surface":
      {
        "expr1":"Value_of_the_solution",
        "expr2":"Volume_concerned"
      }
  }
....
2 *Neumann*

The value of the derivative of the solution is known at the limit of the domain.

[source,json]
.Neumann Condition
....
"Neumann":
  {
    "Surface":
      {
        "expr":"Value_of_derivatives_of_the_solution"
      },
    "other_surface":
      {
        "expr":"Value_of_derivatives_of_the_solution"
      }
  }
....
3 *Robin*

There is a linear relation between the value and the derivative at the limits of the domain.

[source,json]
.Robin Condition
....
"Robin":
  {
    "Surface":
      {
        "expr1":"Value_of_derivatives_of_the_solution",
        "expr2":"Value_of_the_solution"
      },
    "other_surface":
      {
        "expr1":"Value_of_derivatives_of_the_solution",
        "expr2":"Value_of_the_solution"
      }
  }
....

WARNING: Your have to set a condition for each surfaces you have defined.
For those where there is no conditions, set an homogeneous Neumann condition (`"expr":"0"`)
