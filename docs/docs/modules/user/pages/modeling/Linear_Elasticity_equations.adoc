The objective is to calculate the displacement vector *u* and stress generated by the dilatation due to the temperature elevation and the Lorentz forces.

== Conditions and suppositions

We need some preconditions :

* The moments chosen are considered to be at equilibrium
* The only forces considered are the Lorentz force and the thermal expansion.

== Equations

First, we start with the equation of motion, becoming the equilibrium equation :

[stem]
++++
div(\bar{\bar{\sigma}})+\textbf{f}=0
++++

With stem:[\bar{\bar{\sigma}}] the stress tensor and *f* the volume forces applied on the conductor.
As we search the displacement vector *u*, we introduce the tensor of small deformation stem:[\bar{\bar{\epsilon}}]

[stem]
++++
\bar{\bar{\epsilon}}=\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\textbf{u}+\nabla\textbf{u}^{T})
++++

We divide the stress tensor in two terms : stem:[\bar{\bar{\sigma}}^{E}] given by the Hooke's law for the small deformation
and stem:[\bar{\bar{\sigma}}^{T}] bring by the Joule eating.

[stem]
++++
\bar{\bar{\sigma}}(\bar{\bar{\epsilon}})=\bar{\bar{\sigma}}^{E} (\bar{\bar{\epsilon}})+\bar{\bar{\sigma}}^{T}(\bar{\bar{\epsilon}})
++++

This terms are define so :

* stem:[\bar{\bar{\sigma}}^{E}(\bar{\bar{\epsilon}})=\frac{E}{1+\nu}(\bar{\bar{\epsilon}}+\frac{\nu}{1+2\nu}Tr(\bar{\bar{\epsilon}})\bar{\bar{I}})]
* stem:[\bar{\bar{\sigma}}^{T}(\bar{\bar{\epsilon}})=-\frac{E}{1+\nu}\alpha_{T}(T-T_{0})\bar{\bar{I}}]

With :

* stem:[E] the Young modulus
* stem:[\nu] the Poisson's ratio
* stem:[\bar{\bar{I}}] the identity tensor
* stem:[\alpha_{T}] the linear dilatation coefficient
* stem:[T and T_{0}] the temperature at time stem:[t and t_{0}]
