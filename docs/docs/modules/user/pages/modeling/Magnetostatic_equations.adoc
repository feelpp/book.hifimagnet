==== Equations

First of all, we start with two of the four Maxwell's equations :

[stem]
++++
    \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
      \nabla\times\textbf{H}=\textbf{j}\\
      \nabla.\textbf{B}=0 \end{array} \right.
++++

We also can link the magnetic induction (*B*) and the magnetic field (*H*) using the permeability (stem:[\mu]) as :

[stem]
++++
\textbf{B}=\mu\textbf{H}
++++

with stem:[\mu=\mu_{r}\mu_{0}]

* stem:[\mu_{r}] being the permeability specific to the material

* stem:[\mu_{0}] being the vacuum permeability

From the differential operators, we know that stem:[\nabla.\nabla\times\textbf{A}=0]    stem:[\forall] *A*.

Thus, since stem:[\nabla.\textbf{B}=0] there exists *A* such as stem:[\textbf{B}=\nabla\times \textbf{A}]

Finally, we can write :

[stem]
++++
\nabla\times\left(\frac{1}{\mu}\nabla\times\textbf{A}\right)=\textbf{j}
++++

==== Finite Element

==== Boundary conditions

The current density is located in some finite region in space, actually stem:[\Omega], this involves considering *B* as zero at infinity.
But, with the Finite Element Method,we discretize the domain so we impose the domain to be of finite dimension.
In fact, this domain is composed by stem:[\Omega] (the conductor) and a box inside, stem:[\Omega_{c}], whose boundaries model the infinity.
The size of this box can be set manually or be calculated for more precision and validity.
The boundary condition is expressed with the magnetic potential (*A*) like this :

[stem]
++++
\textbf{A}\times\textbf{n}=0\, on\, \partial\Omega_{c}
++++


Our materials allow us to only consider the vacuum permeability, so stem:[\mu=\mu_{0}=4\pi.10^{-7} kg.m.A^{-2} .s^{-2}].
