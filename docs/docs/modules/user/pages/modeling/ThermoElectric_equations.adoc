==== Equations

First of all, we start with the standart heat equation:

[stem]
++++
\rho C_{p}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \nabla.(k \nabla T)=P
++++

The only source of heat considered is the Joule effect, expressed by :

[stem]
++++
P=\textbf{j.E}
++++

where stem:[\textbf{j}=\sigma\textbf{E}] (from the Ohm's law).
But stem:[\exists V | \textbf{E}=-\nabla V]

NOTE: To see more details, link:http://book.feelpp.org/toolbox/thermoelectric[Thermo-Electric Toolbox]

We also consider that T is time independent, so, finally, we have :

[stem]
++++
- \nabla.(k \nabla T)=\sigma\nabla V . \nabla V
++++

Coefficients stem:[\sigma] and k are temperature-dependent as shown in this equations :

* stem:[\sigma=\frac{\sigma_Â {0}}{1 + \alpha(T-T_{ref})}]

* stem:[k=k_{0}\frac{T}{(1+\alpha(T-T_{ref}))T_{ref}}]

==== Finite Element

==== Boundary conditions

The current is due to a difference of potential. We model this with the Dirichlet conditions :

* V=0 on V~in~
* V=V~0~ on V~out~

We consider the air and the cooling water as they are electrically insulating.
On other surfaces we impose homogeneous Neumann conditions as no current "flows" out these surfaces (*j.n*=0).

stem:[-\sigma(T)\nabla V.n=0] for all surfaces except V~in~ and V~out~

On the cooled surfaces, we set the heat transfer coefficient _h_, determined as follow :

stem:[h=\frac{k(T)N_{u}}{D_{h}}] with N~u~ the Nusselt number and D~h~ the hydraulic diameter.
