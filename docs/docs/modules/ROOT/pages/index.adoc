[[introduction]]
== Introduction

High Field Magnets are an essential ingredient for many research areas (e.g. High Energy Physics in CERN, High resolution MRI for NeuroSciences).
The {uri-lncmi-www}[Laboratoire National de Champs Magnétiques Intenses] (LNCMI) is a French large scale facility, also part of {uri-emfl-www}[European Magnetic Field Laboratory] (EMFL),
that build and provides such magnets in solenoidal configuration, enabling researchers to perform experiments in the highest possible magnetic field.
DC magnetic fields up to 37 T are provided at the Grenoble site and pulsed fields up to 99 T at Toulouse.

The technology used for DC magnets relies on the *polyhelix* technic. The magnet consists in a set of Copper alloy tubes,
in  which an helical cut has been machined by Electric Discharge Machining (EDM), connected into series. Each tube is refered as an *helix* and the resulting magnet
is the so-called *PolyHelix insert* cut by EDM.

The use of classical resistive materials as Copper alloy enables to reach higher magnetic field than those provided by magnets
made out of Low Temperature Superconductor material (namely 24.5 tesla). To achieve these values the magnets are powered by 24 MW and
some water cooling is needed to dissipate the Joules losses and keep the magnet temperature bellow some heuristic threshold.


== What is {hifimagnet}?

{hifimagnet} is a research project carried out by the LNCMI in collaboration with
Institut de Recherche Mathématique Avancée (IRMA) and Cemosis.

The goals are twofold:

* to build a hierarchy of numerical models ranging from 2D axi to
  3D, and including more and more physics. The idea here is to
  reconsider the hypothesis that are needed to derive  the
  semi-analytical approximations upon which our standard design and
  optimization procedures are based and ultimately to quantify the
  hypotheses effects;
* to complement our standard design by performing sensitivity
  analysis and uncertainty quantification  on material properties,
  operational parameters and geometric
  clearances. It allows e.g. to identify the important parameters, to
  perform quantile estimation, to compute probability of failure and
  ultimately to provide safety operational controls.

Models have been implemented with the finite element library {uri-feelpp-sources}[Feel++]
 and the {feelpp} toolboxes.

Actually {hifimagnet} is a software chain for High Field Magnets that consist mostly in a set of 3 tools:

* one for pre-processing,
* one for running simulations,
* one for post-processing.

These tools are described in the <<manuals, manuals>> bellow.

{hifimagnet} is currently available:

* natively on Debian/Ubuntu Os,
* throught https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[WSL on Windows 10],
* as private Docker and Singularity images,
* as applications from the https://portal.mso4sc.eu[MSO Portal]

The recommended and easiest way to use {hifimagnet} is throught the portal.
The impatient reader could directly go this xref::mso4sc#msoportal[section] for pratical details and
some examples.
