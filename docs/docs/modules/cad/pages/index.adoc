Welcome to {hifimagnet} Salome Plugin documentation!

NOTE: The {hifimagnet} Salome Plugin documentation describes its installation, its features, its uses  and
provides some references.


[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The {hifimagnet} Salome Plugin allows to easily:

* define CAD geometry for Solenoidal High Field Magnet,
* mesh these geometries,
* provide a template for {hifimagnet} simulation setup.

In a near future, the plugin will also provides tools:

* to run calculations either locally or remotely,
* to analyze the results


[NOTE]
====

 * Supported {salome} versions are: from 9.2.0 to 9.5.0
 * The meshing features require a license to http://www.meshgems.com/[{meshgems} suite].
 * {salome} docker image without {hifimagnet}Â plugin can be found on this link:https://hub.docker.com/r/trophime/[dockerhub].

====

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use Salome in GUI mode the docker container should contain appropriate graphics drivers
supporting OpenGL 4.5.

[[qs_getting]]
=== Getting {hifimagnet} Salome plugin

They are several way to use {hifimagnet} Salome plugin. The easiest way
is to use container, either Docker based or Singularity based. *If your system support
singularity containers we recommend to use them instead of Docker ones*.


[[qs_reference]]
=== Running {hifimagnet} Salome plugin

{hifimagnet} Salome plugin can be run either in *GUI* or *TUI* mode.
*TUI* stands for Terminal User Interface.

To switch to *TUI* mode, use `-t` option.
Add `-b` option to the use TUI in batch mode.

NOTE: In the sequel, we use the classical *Unix* notation for command.
In peculiar `[...]` denotes optional argument.

==== from Singularity container

Assuming we use `salome.simg` singularity image:

[source,sh]
----
singularity exec [--nv] \
  [-H $HOME:/home/$USER] \
  -B $STORE/DISTENE/DLim:/opt/DISTENE/DLim:ro \
  salome.simg \
  salome -w1 [-t -b] ...
----

where:

* `$STORE/DISTENE/DLim` is the directory on the host containing a valid `dlim8.key` license file.
You need to adapt this to your configuration.

[NOTE]
====

* the `--nv` flag is mandatory to run in GUI mode and is only supported by nvidia drivers.
For other graphic video card, use `mesa_salome` instead of `salome`
* On {lncmi} server option `-H $HOME:/home/$USER` may be dropped

====

[TIP]
====

* To check your graphic video card on Debian/Ubuntu you may use `inxi -G`.
* You may use a relative or absolute path for the image `salome.simg`.

====

==== from Docker container

[source,sh]
----
xhost local:root
docker run -ti --rm -e DISPLAY \
   --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host \
   --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
   -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
   -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/home/feelpp/.Xauthority \
   -v $STORE/DISTENE/DLim:/opt/DISTENE/DLim:ro \
   feelpp/salome:9.5.1 salome [-t -b] ...
----

where:

* `$STORE/DISTENE/DLim` is the directory containing a valid `dlim8.key` license file.

IMPORTANT: You have to be a member of *feelpp team* in dockerhub to have access to the docker image.

[TIP]
====
On Windows:

* Start https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] (that provides a running X11 server)
* Then run:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY :0 feelpp/salome:9.5.1
----

On MacOs X:

* start https://www.xquartz.org/[XQuartz]
* In XQuartz: `defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true`
* Restart XQuartz
* Then run:

[source,sh]
----
ip=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')
xhost +$ip
docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY $ip:0 feelpp/salome-9.5.1
----

You may need to adapt the line to get the working `ip` of your machine depending
on your internet connection.

See this http://files.salome-platform.org/Salome/Common/SUD2018/08_Containers.pdf[presentation] for details
====

==== Main commands

We will omit the part of the command related to the use of {singularity} or {docker} to only give
the {salome} command. If you plan to run these commands from a {singularity} or {docker} image,
just start the container (see <<qs_reference, here>>, watch out to not forget to enable the display
if you want to use the GUI mode).

Examples files may be found https://github.com/Trophime/singularity-salome/tree/develop/test[here].

The structure of the `yaml` file describing the geometry and mesh be generated will
be described in the <<data, data structure section>>. 

[[insert-cad]]
[source,sh]

`$HIFIMAGNET` is the install directory of {hifimagnet} {salome} plugin, eg `/opt/SALOME-9.5.0-UB18.04/INSTALL/HIFIMAGNET/bin/salome`.

image::ex_CAD_Insert_Air.png[A 4 helix insert with sourring air (in transparent red)]

[NOTE]
====

* An example `Insert-H1H4-Leads-2t.yaml` can be found in `/usr/local/share/salome/H1H4` in  singularity images.
* If you are using containers, the shell command above is to be executed within the container. The container shall
be launched from the directory that holds the `yaml` file you will use in the shell command.

====

[TIP]
====
Building CAD for an insert may require a long long time and a large amount of RAM.
Thus it is adviced to run the CAD generation within a `screen` session on an appropriate machine
(eg. {lncmi} servers for {lncmi} user).

Moreover, it is also adviced to run first the CAD generation for the insert, then add the air and finally mesh.
Avoid trying to build CAD and Mesh at once.
====

[[data]]
== Data Structure

An insert consists in a set of:

* helices,
* connection rings

and eventually an inner and an outer currentLead.

Each structure is defined as a `yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
The `yaml` files for helices are generated from the insert optimized geometry `insert.d` by running `opt2yml`.
Similarily, the helical cut files are obtained by running `opt2cad`. Please refer to xref:magnettools:Optimization.adoc#cadcam[here] for details.

The generated files still need some user intervention to be complete - namely dimension of the cylnder tube
has to be added manually. Check with the Bureau d'etudes for these dimensions

As for Rings and CurrentLeads, the files must be generated manually.
====

=== helix structure

An helix is actually a cylindrical tube which exhibit a single or double helical cut made by EDM.
The path of the helical cut is provided in a separate file: `*_cut_salome.dat` if no shapes are added
to the helical cut, or  `*_cut_with_shapes_salome.dat` otherwise.
The `*_cut[_with_shapes]_salome.dat` file are generated from the optimized geofile `.d`
describing the axisymetrical geometry using `opt2cad` and eventually `add_shape`.
See xref:magnettools:Optimization.adoc#cadcam[here] for details. 

[[helix]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/H_struct.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD to be created (must begin with an "H").
<2> specify if the helix is single or double (ie. helical cut).

<4> the radial dimension in *mm*.
<5> the axial dimension in *mm*.
<6> the width of the helical cut.
<7> the corresponding <<helix_axi, axi model section>>.
<8> the ............  <<helix_m3d, 3d model section>>.
<9> definition of the <<helix_shape, shape>> added along the helical path

image::ex_CAD_H.png[A longitudinally cooled helix]

==== `axi` structure

The `axi` structure defines the helical cut along with the file `*_cut_salome.dat` 

[[helix_axi]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/H_axi.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the axisymetrical description of the magnet (see magnettools)
<2> half electrical length; stem:[2h] corresponds to the axial length of the helical path centered on the origin.
<3> list of pitch stem:[p_i]
<4> list of turns stem:[n_i]

The helical path consists in a set of stem:[i] helices with a pitch stem:[p_i] and a number of turns stem:[n_i]

==== `m3d` structure

[[helix_m3d]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/H_m3d.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD geometry (usually stems from the Bureau d'Etudes nomemclature to keep track of the CADs)
<2> indicates wether shapes are added or not on the helical path
<3> indicates wether micro-cooling channels are added (only for radial helices)

==== `shape` structure

[[helix_shape]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/H_shape.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the shape to be added
<2> name of CAD profile (Actually the name of the shape file description without extension aka `.dat`; the name is build as `Shape_CADID` where `CADID` comes from the Bureau d'Etudes nomemclature to keep track of the CADs; ) 
<3> list of angular length of the shape in *degree*
<4> list of angular shift between 2 consecutive shapes (optionnal)
<5> list of turn number on which the shape are disposed
<6> orientation of the shape (values valid are ...)

The shape file description is a simple `.dat` file that defines the number of points of the shape and theirs coordinates in a local cartesian frame:

[[shape]]
[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Shape.dat[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Data in this section are just given for the records. They are not used for building the helical cut of the attached *helix*.
In future versions, it is planned to use these data to eventually build the helical cut if needed. So please kind the data
synced with the actual configuration.
====

==== `helical cut` structure

The geometry of the `helical cut` is computed using {magnettools}. It provides
the coordinates of the cut in developed form which will be mapped onto the outer cylinder boundary of an helix.

[[helix_cut]]
[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/H_cut_salome.dat[]
----
<1> header
<2> `theta`, `Z_i` defines the coordinates of the point in a 2D cartesian frame (note: stem:[\text{theta} \in [0,2\pi*n_{turns}]] with stem:[n_{turns}] the total number of turn of the path) and `Shape_id` indicates the precense or absence of shape and eventually of micro-cooling channel

=== Ring

A ring ensure the electrical and mechanical connection between 2 consecutive helices.
It is a cylinder eventually with stem:[n] cylindrical slots, disposed at regular angular interval stem:[angle] in it to ensure a proper cooling of the connected helices.

[[ring]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/R.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD to be created (must begin with "R")
// (it corresponds to the name in the {lncmi} Bureau d'Etudes nomemclature).

<3> the radial dimension in *mm*.
<4> the axial dimension in *mm*.
<5> indicates the presence or the absence of cylindrical slot

image::ex_CAD_R.png[A connection ring]

=== CurrentLeads

==== Inner Lead

In general, the inner current lead is made of a cylinder in which stem:[n_holes] rectangular windows
are cut. If the dimensions of the first helix and the inner lead do not match, there is an additional
part to make the connection between the current lead and the helix. For sake of simplicity, this part
, refered as *support*, has been "incorporated" into the lead.

[[inner]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/inner.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD to be created (must begin with an "I")
<2> list of radius (inner, outer)
<3> height of the current lead

<6> characteristic for the support ([R2, DZ])

image::ex_CAD_Inner.png[An inner current lead]

==== Outer Lead

Outer current lead consists in an assembly of an connection ring and 2 sets of 3 bars
with rectangular cross-section stem:[dx \times dy]. The support correspond to the small part that make the
connection between the ring and the bars. The support is made of 6 parallelepiped disposed at regular angular
interval stem:[d\alpha]

[[outer]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/outer.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD to be created (must begin with an "O")
<2> list of radius (inner, outer)
<3> height of the current lead
<4> characteristic of the support (DX0, DZ, stem:[d\alpha], stem:[\alpha_0] the angular shift)
<5> characteristic of the bar (R, stem:[dx], stem:[dy], stem:[L] the length of the bar)

image::ex_CAD_Outer.png[A outer current lead composed of 6 bars]

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are some requirements on the total length of the inner and outer current lead.
Indeed, when the CAD for the insert we arbitrary requires that the bottom of the inner and outer lead
have the same `z` coordinates.
====

=== Insert

[[insert]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Insert.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD geometry
<2> list of helices
<3> list of rings
<4> define inner and outer current leads
<5> radius of the inner bore tube
<6> radius of the external tube holding the helices insert
<7> angular orientation of helices (optionnal)
<8> angular orientation of rings (optionnal)


=== Mesh

The mesh is generated from the command line when the option `--mesh` is passed to salome.
The first time the mesh is generated, a file , namely `Insert_meshdata.yaml` where `Insert.yaml` is
the actual yaml cfg file used in the main command line, is also created containing main mesh parameters.
This file may be later used to regenerate the same mesh or modify to get a finner or coarser mesh.

So far only {meshgems} mesher is supported.

Here is an example of the yaml cfg file:

[[mesh]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/Insert_meshdata.yaml[]
----
<1> name of the CAD geometry without extension
<2> basename of the output mesh
<3> mesh algorithm used for surfacic meshes
<4> mesh algorithm used for volumic meshes
<5> maximum ratio between the lengths of two adjacent edges.
<6> allows checking input and output files of MG-Tetra software, while usually these files are removed after the launch of the mesher. The log file (if any) is also kept if this option is `1`.
<7> allows grouping volumes into domains
<8> allows choosing the required optimization level (higher level of optimization provides better mesh, but can be time-consuming); values are 1: none, 2: light, 3: medium (standard), 4: standard+, 5: strong

<9> removes or not files upon mesh completion 
<10> launches MG-Tetra software with work space limited to the specified amount of RAM, in Mbytes. If this option is checked off, the software will be launched with 7O% of the total RAM space. 
<11> list of input data for the surfacic mesher provided for each boundary group defined in the CAD geometry 

The input data for the surfacic mesher (or hypothesys in {salome} formalism) are defined as follows:

[[surfhypoth]]
[source,yml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/surfhypot.yaml[]
----
<1> the name of the consider boundary group
<2> the actual hypothesis are:

* `2` for
* `1` for
* `physsize` for setting the requested element size in *mm*
* `minsize` for setting the minimum allowed element size in *mm*
* `maxsize` for setting the maximum allowed size in *mm*
* `chordalerror` for setting the requested chordalerror size in *mm*

[NOTE]
====
The `chordalerror` is the maximum desired distance between a triangle and its supporting CAD surface.
The smaller this distance is, the closer the mesh is to the exact surface (only available in isotropic meshing).
====

 
=== Advanced mesh options

The mesh can customized using the yaml cgf file presented above. There are also some options to reduce the number of surfacic meshes that will be latter use to apply boundary conditions:

* `--hideIsolant`:
* `--groupIsolant`:
* `--groupCoolingChannels`: 
* `--groupLeads`:

and there is also an `--coarse` option to generate a quite coarse mesh.

These options are available in the main command line:

[[setup]]
== Generate Templates setup for {hifimagnet} simulations

Add `-setup` option to the command line to generate template files required
for the setup of {hifimagnet} simulations.

[[checking]]
== Using {salome} for Checking and/or Debugging

{salome} is an open-source generic platform for Pre- and Post-Processing for numerical simulation.
