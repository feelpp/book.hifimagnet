====
As a rule of the thumb, a mesh of 1 Go would mean to use 2 T Ram for fully coupled simulations.
Consequently, simulations have to be run on an appropriate machine:

* up to 1T Ram, you may use xref:Infrastructure#lab_servers[{lncmi} ressources],
* above, you have to go for xref:Infrastructure#meso_ressources[Gricad ressources]
