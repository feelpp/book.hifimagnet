link:{uri-singularity}[{singularity}] is a program that enables to build
containers for HPC systems. In contrast to {docker}, user does not need
to be *root* to use {singularity} containers or images. *rrot* user is only
needed when building the [singlauraty} image.

== Testing {singularity}

* pull an image
* run the image

== Basic usage

Running a shell:
[source,bash]
----
singularity shell image.sif
----

Executing a program:
[source,bash]
----
singularity exec image.sif ...
----

List apps defined in an image:
[source,bash]
----
singularity image.sif ...
----

Running an app:
[source,bash]
----
singularity image.sif ...
----

== Running parallel jobs in {singularity}

[source,bash]
----
singularity exec image.sif mpirun -np n ...
----

[IMPORTANT]
====

* On *SMP* machine

[source,bash]
----
mpirun -np n singularity exec image.sif ...
