== Magnets Monitoring

In this paragraph we present the main principle of the magnet monitoring.

image:hydraulics.png[Schematic Magnet cooling system]

High Field Magnets are electromagnets made of copper alloys tubes
- connected into series be so-called ring - powered with up to 31 kA to deliver up to 37 tesla.
To dissipate the electric powered the magnet are cooled by a water forced flow (up to 140 l:m³
with a pressure drop of 25 bars). Therefore the magnets are actually set into a housing.
Such environment (water and high pressure) make it difficult to instrument the magnets.

The only available measures come from:

* voltage taps on the connection ring between consecutive tube,
* water temperature probes at the inlet and outlet of the cooling circuit,
* flow rate sensor.

In addition to these data, we also have access to:

* the total voltage drop stem:[V],
* the total electric power stem:[P],
* and the field factor stem:[f], ie. the ratio of the magnetic field stem:[B_z(0)] at the magnetic
center over the input current stem:[I]. stem:[f] is experimentally obtained by measuring the magnetic
field profile along the magnet stem:[Oz] axis at a given current. Note that this actually relies on
the hypothesis of linear dependency of stem:[ß] versus stem:[I].

The magnet is actually operated by setting the input current stem:[I]. In practice, the user request
a value of stem:[B_z(0)] on a console which, in turn, send an order to power supply to deliver a
current stem:[I=\frac{B_z(0)}{f}]. During this operation, the monitoring system receive data from
the voltage taps stem:[U_i], water temperatures probes (stem:[Ti, To]) and flow rate stem:[Q] sensor.

In this example, the magnet consists in 2 "tranches" operating at 9h57
and providing a 18.8 tesla magnetic field:

* tranche 1:  a 14 PolyHelices insert
* tranche 2:  2 external Bitter magnets.

Coils 1 to 7 correspond to the PolyHelix insert (one per couple of helices);
Coils 15 and 16 to the Bitters.

Data specific to each "tranche" is appended with the tranche index.

stem:[dPm1] denote the pressure drop from HP and BP side on tranche 1
where HP, BP stand respectively for High and Low ("Basse" in french) Pressure.

stem:[T_i] denote the estimated mean temperature in Coil stem:[i].
See bellow for more details.

Actual data from an magnet in operation may be retreive from the link:http://147.173.83.216/site/sba/pages/index.php[control/command monitoring system].
This site, ony accesible to registered {lncmi} user, provides
data recorded during a magnet run. To access a magnet run:

* Go to the menu *Courbes/Fichier Aimants*.
* Select a file `txt` from a site (eg M9).

You can then explore the magnet data and download the file for latter use by clicking on *Télécharger txt*.
The `txt` file may be converted to a `csv` file using link:{attachmentsdir}/txt2cvs.py[`txt2cvs.py`]. An example can be found link:{attachmentsdir}/M9_2019.06.20-14_36_30.csv[here].

[[control]]
== Magnets Control

The control system relies on these data to determine if the operating magnet is safe or not.
More precisely it checks the deviation stem:[dR0_i] of the resistance measured for each voltage tap
(ie stem:[R0_i = \frac{U_i}{I}]) from a reference value. An heuristic threshold of 3% is considered
as an indicator of a wrong behavior. Once this threshold is reached, a signal is send to
power supply leading to a controlled power shutdown. This means that stem:[I] is driven to 0
in a controlled manner (typically in roughly a tenth of second).

The reference values for stem:[R0_i] are determined during the magnet commissioning following
this process:

* For stem:[I_n]
* Measure stem:[U] per helix (or couple of helices)
* Compute stem:[R=\frac{U}{I}]
* Repeat for new stem:[I_n+1] until 30 kA is reached

Then, a fit for each stem:[R] as a 2nd order polynomial of stem:[I] is computed.
This fit will also be usefull to have an estimate of the mean temperature stem:[<T>] of the helix (or couple of helices):

[stem]
++++
R=R(I=0)\,(1+\alpha (<T>-T_0))
++++
with stem:[T_0] a reference temperature (generally 20C).

[NOTE]
====
* These experiments have to be carried out carefully to get proper estimates of the resistance.
Indeed, we have stem:[U = R I + M\,\frac{dI}{dt}] with stem:[M] the inductance matrix. So if no estimate
of the inductance is available (either from calculations or experiments), we have to wait to reach
steady state before measuring stem:[U].

* In normal operation, the flow rate stem:[Q] and Pressure drop stem:[dPm] are functions of stem:[I].
As a consequence the heat exchange coefficient  stem:[h] per cooling channels will also be function of stem:[I].

// Ivar = 28.e+03; //in A
//	Vpump = (I>Ivar) ? 2840 : 1000 + 840*(I/Ivar)^2; //in rpm/mm
//	Flowpump = 140 * 1.e-3 * Vpump/2840.; //in m3/s
// Pressure = 20 * (Vpump/2840)*(Vpump/2840); //in bar !!!  1bar=10^5 Pa !!!
